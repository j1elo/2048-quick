2048-quick
==========

This is a Work-In-Progress clone of the popular [2048 game](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) made by Gabriele Cirulli. Instead of using Web technologies as in the original implementation, this project is made with the latest technologies offered by *[Qt 5](http://qt-project.org/)*.

The core of the game is implemented as a module independent of any specific GUI. On top of that, a *QML/Qt Quick 2* UI shows the game assets.

This software is just a proof of concept and by no means is yet to be considered as a finalised product.
